        <main id="About-me">
        <p>Nearly a decade working in the food industry. I have held nearly every position in the back of house from dish washer to kitchen manager.
        At just 22 years old I was promoted to kitchen manager at the cheesecake factory, and worked with other managers on the team to maintain an exceptional restaurant. With over 12 million dollars in sales annually I worked with line cooks and prep cooks both to ensure perfect food quality while working safely and sanitary.
        Over the years I have worked relentlessly to increase my food knowledge and recipe depth. 
        Recently started a web development bootcamp at the University of Utah. Focusing on building interactive websites from the ground up. All projects will be up on my github profile as they are completed.
